                                            Your subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel. You authorize us to store your payment method(s) and to automatically charge your payment method(s) every month until you cancel. We will automatically charge you the then-current rate for your plan, plus applicable taxes (such as VAT or GST if the rate does not include it), every month of your contract length until you cancel. The length of our subscription package is 3months from the moment your initial payment is processed, and your term will keep on rolling thereafter until you decide to cancel.

                                        We may change your plan’s rate and we will notify you of any rate change with the option to cancel. If the applicable VAT or GST rate (or other included tax or duty) changes during your term, we will accordingly adjust the tax-inclusive price for your plan on your next billing date.

                                        <p style="padding: 10px 0px;"></p>
                                        If your primary payment method fails, you authorize us to charge any other payment method in your account. If you have not provided us a backup payment method(s) and you fail to provide payment, or if all payment methods in your account fail, we may suspend your subscription. You can edit your payment information anytime on your PVDATA software.

                                        For European Economic Area customers, your bank may require you to authenticate your initial purchase using a password, a one-time code sent to your mobile number, or biometric recognition. When you authenticate, you also authorize us to charge your payment method for your additional purchases without providing us further payment information or other instructions (i.e., we will initiate future payments independently). Such additional purchases may occur when we automatically charge your payment method in connection with a recurring subscription or when you add or change licenses or products.
